# Keurig Recreation

A simple, yet very fun project to work on. The goal was to recreate the Keurig website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was a great way to brush up on the basics, while also adhering to the design and functionality of the original website. 

It was a fun way to practice building off of a "prototype", and allowed me to try to attempt and make a accurate recreation of a professional design.
