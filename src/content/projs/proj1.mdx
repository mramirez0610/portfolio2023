# [Keurig Recreation](https://in-info-web4.informatics.iupui.edu/~ramimarc/n315/keurig/dist/#home)

A small project where I was tasked to recreate Keurig's "Coffee Maker" section of their website. I used JQuery to create most of the site, with Firebase Authentication to handle the login and LocalStorage to save the user's cart. The main goal of this project was to recreate the site as closely as possible.

## Technology Used

- JQuery
- Firebase Authentication
- LocalStorage
