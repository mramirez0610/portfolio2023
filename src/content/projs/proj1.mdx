This project was an engaging endeavor where I was given the responsibility to meticulously replicate the "Coffee Maker" section of Keurig's official website. The primary objective of this project was to mirror the original site as accurately as possible, paying close attention to every detail and ensuring a seamless user experience.

To accomplish this, I leveraged the power of JQuery, a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. In addition to JQuery, I utilized Firebase Authentication, a robust, easy-to-use service provided by Google. Firebase Authentication provides backend services to securely authenticate users.

To enhance the user experience further, I implemented LocalStorage, a web storage object that allows storing data persistently in a user's browser. With LocalStorage, I was able to save the user's cart information, providing the users with the convenience of keeping their selected items even after they close the browser or turn off the system.

Overall, this project was a comprehensive exercise in recreating a complex, real-world website, and it provided me with valuable experience in JQuery, Firebase Authentication, and LocalStorage.
