# Climb Time Indy

Climb Time Indy is a rock climbing gym located in Indianapolis, Indiana. This was my first website for a local business, and is a passion project that's currently a work in progress. The goal was to completely redo the website, and make it more modern and up to par with the current web standards. 

Though it's purely a brochure at the time being, the plan is to allow ecommerce and integration with Rock Gym Pro, which includes punch passes, memberships, gift cards, and scheduling.
