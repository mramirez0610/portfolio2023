# Climb Time Indy

Climb Time Indy is a rock climbing gym located in Indianapolis, Indiana. This was my first website for a local business, and is a passion project that's currently a work in progress. The goal was to completely redo the website, and make it more modern and up to par with the current web standards. Allows ecommerce and integration with Rock Gym Pro, which includes punch passes, memberships, gift cards, and scheduling.

## Technology Used

- Next.JS
- SASS
- Netlify
- Decap CMS
- Integration of Rock Gym Pro
