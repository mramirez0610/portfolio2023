# Data Application

This was my first dive into React, and I loved every second of it. The goal of this project was to create a simple data application that displays information from a JSON file. I decided to make the web app about one of my favorite artists (Aphex Twin), and display his discography. The web app also doubles as a music player, allowing the user to listen to the album/track they select. 

This project was a great way to learn the basics of React, while also learning how to convert JSON data into interactive elements. I learned a lot during the time making this project, and I'm grateful for the experience.

## Technology Used
