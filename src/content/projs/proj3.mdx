# What Should I Eat?

A small web app that I made in my freetime. I always find myself wanting to learn how to cook, though whenever I try to decide, I experience choice paralysis. What if what I make is gross? What if it's too bland? Maybe I could be making something better? Really, most of the time I just don't know what to make. So I decided to make this after hearing someone mention they use AI to decide what to cook.

It's simple. I use OpenAI's API to call a request, which contains the user's ingredients, as well as how much they like that item. The API call then returns a new recipe everytime according to ingredients and preference. It makes for a fun time when you're bored, and and even better time when you're hungry.
