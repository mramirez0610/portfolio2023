# [Data Application](https://mramirez0610.github.io/project2repo/)

My first endeavor into using React for a project. This project was a simple data application that took a JSON file and converted it into an interactive application. The application was a music player that allowed the user to select a song and play it. The application also listed data about the album and the artist. This project taught me lots about state management, which was used to navigate between the different albums.

## Technology Used

- React
- React Router
- Converting JSON into interactive elements
