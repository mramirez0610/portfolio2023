# Headless CMS

The goal of this project was to create small, simple website that's completely editable using a headless CMS. I used Decap CMS to create a simple "store" that allows the user to add, edit, and delete "products". I wanted to focus on responsive design, as well as css animations as a way to improve my design abilities.

This project was a great way to learn how to use a headless CMS, and how to implement it into a website. I learned a lot about how to use Decap CMS, and how to create a fast, efficient, editable product for someone who's interested in creating a website that's easy to manage.
