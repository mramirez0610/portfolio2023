# Headless CMS

This project was an exciting endeavor that involved reconstructing a prototype with a focus on maintaining design fidelity and consistency throughout the development process. The technology stack chosen for this project was a combination of JQuery and Sass.

On the other hand, Sass, a mature, stable, and powerful professional-grade CSS extension language, was employed to make the styling of the project more efficient and maintainable.

For the task of user authentication, Firebase Authentication was utilized. In addition to user authentication, data storage was another crucial aspect of this project. For this purpose, Firestore was employed. Firestore is a flexible, scalable NoSQL cloud database that can store and sync data for client- and server-side development. It was instrumental in efficiently managing the data storage needs of the project.

In summary, this project was a comprehensive exercise in recreating a complex prototype, providing valuable experience in using JQuery, Sass, Firebase Authentication, and Firestore. It was a testament to the power of these technologies in creating a secure, efficient, and user-friendly web application.
